                    <p>I am currently a second year Computer Systems Engineering student at Carleton University in Ottawa aspiring to become a software engineer. The purpose of this site is to have a place for me to showcase my software projects as well as track the progression of my struggles and success throughout my journey. Feel free to browse around! </p>

                    <p>Starting January of 2015, I will be a Software Developer Co-op student at IBM working within the Report Studio Development Team for one of IBM's business intelligence products. Very excited about that! 
                    This is a 4 month term after which I will be looking for other co-op work terms before I go back to Carleton University to finish my second year in January 2016.
